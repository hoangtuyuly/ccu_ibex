class FlowRestrictor(BinaryActor):
    """A component which passes through a specific number of values through the
    stream when instructed.

    In its idle state, the stream is paused and no packets flow from the
    input to the output. But when a number N arrives at the *release* endpoint,
    N values will be permitted to pass through the stream. Then it goes back to
    its paused state.

    Parameters
    ----------

    payload_type: Shape
      The payload shape/layout for the stream whose flow is being restricted.

    Attributes
    ----------

    input: Endpoint, in
      Input stream.

    output: Endpoint, out
      Output stream.

    release: Endpoint(32), in
      Stream which triggers the flow restrictor to release more values.
      When a value N is received at this endpoint, N values will be permitted
      to pass from *input* to *output*.

Firefly Algorithm Summary
=========================
FA is a genetic algorithm that maintains a pool of fireflies. Each
firefly emits a light whose intensity is non-decreasing in (or simply equal
to) the objective value. Each iteration, a firefly chases after a brighter
firefly, but the brightness it perceives decreases in distance. This allows
multiple "clusters" to form, as opposed to all fireflies collapsing to a
single point. Not included in the original algorithm, we added "repulsion" which
in addition to the "attraction" forces, meaning fireflies move towards the
bright spots as well as away from the dark spots. We also support non-decimal
parameter types (categorical, discrete, integer), and treat them uniquely when
computing distance, adding pertrubation, and mutating fireflies.

For more details, see the linked paper.

OSS Vizier Implementation Summary
=================================
We maintain a pool of fireflies. Each firefly stores the best trial it created.
During 'Suggest' each firefly on its turn is used to suggest a new trial. The
best trial parameters are used to compute distances and to generate new
suggested parameters by calling the '_mutate' and '_perturb' methods. During
'Update' the trial results comeback and we create a new firefly if needed or
update/remove the associated firefly in the pool. To facilitate this
association, during 'Suggest', the newly created suggested trial stores in
its metadata the id of its parent firefly ('parent_fly_id'). Throughout the
study lifetime, the same firefly could be associated with multiple trials
created from it.

In our stateful implementation, across 'Suggest' calls, we persist the pool of
fireflies and update it using previously unseen COMPLETED trials. We also
persist the last firefly used to generate a suggestion so to not use
sequentially the same firefly even if there are ACTIVE trials. Lastly we persist
the maximum value of firefly id created, to ensure that each firefly has its own
unique id.

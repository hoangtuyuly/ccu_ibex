## What is Open Source (OSS) Vizier?

[OSS Vizier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13676) is a Python-based service for blackbox optimization and research, based on [Google Vizier](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3097983.3098043), one of the first hyperparameter tuning services designed to work at scale.

OSS Vizier's interface consists of three main APIs:

* [**User API:**](https://oss-vizier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/index.html#for-users) Allows a user to setup an OSS Vizier Server, which can host blackbox optimization algorithms to serve multiple clients simultaneously in a fault-tolerant manner to tune their objective functions.
* [**Developer API:**](https://oss-vizier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/index.html#for-developers) Defines abstractions and utilities for implementing new optimization algorithms for research and to be hosted in the service.
* [**Benchmarking API:**](https://oss-vizier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/index.html#for-benchmarking) A wide collection of objective functions and methods to benchmark and compare algorithms.

Please see OSS Vizier's [ReadTheDocs documentation](https://oss-vizier.readthedocs.io/) for detailed information.




## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
To install the **core API**, the simplest way is to run:

```
pip install google-vizier
```

which will download the code and launch the provided `install.sh`. This script installs the necessary dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and builds the relevant protobuf libraries needed for the service. OSS Vizier requires Python 3.10+, while client-only packages require Python 3.7+.

For **full installation** (in particular to support **all algorithms and benchmarks**), you will need to install all dependencies via `install_extras.sh`. This will install the following:

* `requirements-jax.txt`: Jax libraries shared by both algorithms and benchmarks.
* `requirements-tf.txt`: Tensorflow libraries shared by both algorithms and benchmarks.
* `requirements-algorithms.txt`: Additional repositories (e.g. Emukit) for algorithms.
* `requirements-benchmarks.txt`: Additional repositories (e.g. NASBENCH-201) for benchmarks.

Check if all unit tests work by running `run_tests.sh`.

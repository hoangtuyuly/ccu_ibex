[> Intro
--------
LiteHyperBus provides a small footprint and configurable HyperBus core.

LiteHyperBus is part of LiteX libraries whose aims are to lower entry level of
complex FPGA cores by providing simple, elegant and efficient implementations of components used in
today's SoC such as Ethernet, SATA, PCIe, SDRAM Controller...

Using Migen to describe the HDL allows the core to be highly and easily configurable.

LiteHyperBus can be used as LiteX library or can be integrated with your standard
design flow by generating the verilog rtl that you will use as a standard core.

[> Features

[> Tests
--------
Unit tests are available in ./test/.
To run all the unit tests:
  ./setup.py test
